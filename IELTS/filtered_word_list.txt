writing
is
demanding
task
and
many
students
need
more
time
than
expected
to
their
to
speed
up
the
process
we
highlight
some
tools
strategies
as
well
as
writing
guides
we
recommend
start
ing
early
in
the
research
process
with
writing
and
to
pare
research
articles
not
after
but
in
parallel
to
the
lab
or
work
we
suggest
considering
writing
as
team
enterprise
which
needs
proper
organization
and
reg
feedback
in
addition
it
is
helpful
to
select
potential
target
journals
early
and
to
consider
not
only
scope
but
also
decision
times
and
rejection
rates
before
submission
instructions
to
authors
and
should
be
considered
and
drafts
should
be
revised
later
in
the
process
editor
and
reviewer
comments
should
be
followed
our
tips
and
tools
help
stu
dents
and
advisors
to
structure
the
writing
and

process
thereby
stimulating

introduction
writing
is
critical
competence
for
careers
in
graduate
students
and
researchers
have
to
write
to
communicate
their
and
to
develop
their
as
renowned
scientists
science
is
highly
competitive
in
science
is
often
measured
by
the
number
of
pub
and
citations
researchers
and
students
who
are
able
to
communicate
well
are
not
only
successful
in
for
themselves
but
also
for
their
institute
and
university
in
the
long
run
publications
pave
the
path
to
job
positions
collaborations
and
better
funding
thus
it
for
students
and
researchers
to
achieve
in
writing
students
and
researchers
are
usually
well
trained
and
motivated
in
designing
performing
experiments
and
ana
data
however
many
of
them
received
no
formal
training
in
writing
and
struggle
with
various
challenges
during
the
writing
process
see
ref
for
of
cognitive
and
cultural
demands
of
writ
ing
as
consequence
many
relevant
do
not
reach
their
target
audiences
students
and
make
the
mistake
of
understanding
the
preparation
of
articles
as
separate
phase
in
the
research
process
to
be
done
after
completing
experiments
many
students
and
advisors
are
not
aware
of
available
tools
and
guides
through
this
essay
we
highlight
few
important
tips
for
writing
which
could
also
be
considered
for
theses
proposals
review
articles
and
other
text
types
we
also
suggest
various
writing
guides
and
software
tools
writing
less
demanding
and
more
exciting
early
beginning
is
beneficial
writing
is
learning
process
and
one
masters
through
experience
therefore
we
recommend
the
step
in
this
process
is
extensive
and
attentive
reading
in
order
to
get
an
overview
of
the
published
also
to
acknowledge
the
structure
and
style
of
it
is
here
during
this
stage
where
many
students
do
not
invest
time
to
read
enough
so
as
to
gain
sound
grasp
over
their
literature

we

in

and
should

and
should
be
enough
to
negotiate
selecting
journal
we
recommend
choosing
the
target
journal
early
in
process
indeed
we
suggest
having
the
selected
while
preparing
the
rough
draft
of
this
is
because
different
journals
low
different
schools
of
thought
have
different
article
types
and
different
stylistic
and
bibliographic
require
therefore
writing
an
article
directed
towards
journal
not
only
helps
to
choose
the
appropriate
content
and
style
but
also
saves
time
and
avoids
and
deadlocks
during
the
preparation
of
the
article
according
to
et
al
about
peer
reviewed
research
journals
exist
worldwide
this
means
that
there
are
enough
publishing
opportunities
in
almost
every
of
science
while
selecting
target
journal
it
to
carry
out
an
analysis
of
aims
and
scope
of
the
journal
to
examine
the
type
of
articles
that
are
being
pub
with
respect
to
their
structure
methodology
topic
additionally
crucial
aspects
that
need
due
consideration
while
selecting
journals
especially
by
ate
students
and
new
researchers
are
decision
times
rates
the
decision
time
for
journal
is
as
the
time
between
manuscript
submission
and
the
editor
decision
the
information
regarding
could
be
obtained
in
three
ways
all
journals
print
dates
of
submission
and
acceptance
together
with
publications
some
journals
also
provide
decision
times
on
their
web
pages
lastly
one
may
also
ask
for
the
decision
time
of
journal
by
sending
polite
email
to
the
managing
editor
information
regarding
acceptance
be
found
on
journal
websites
another
parameter
that
is
often
referred
to
by
researchers
while
selecting
journal
is
the
impact
factor
the
impact
factor
if
devised
by
eugene
the
average
number
of
citations
to
articles
pub
in
the
journal
the
if
is
used
to
compare
and
standard
of
different
journals
in
lar
discipline
journals
with
high
if
are
considered
of
high
and
often
researchers
are
on
the
ifs
of
the
journals
they
have
published
in
ref
nonetheless
the
if
is
merely
arithmetic
and
if
should
not
be
used
as
parameter
to
evaluate
the
quality
of
work
performed
by
researcher
furthermore
the
if
has
various
shortcomings
and
should
not
be
considered
as
the
sole
criteria
for
assess
ing
journal
reputation
other
metrics
that
could
be
used
for
selecting
target
journals
are
immediacy
index
index
and
journal
rank
additional
criteria
to
be
considered
are
for
instance
informal
reputation
of
the
journal
open
access
options
copyright
regulations
publication
costs
and
systems
nurturing
the
manuscript
once
student
has
writing
manuscript
thesis
there
must
be
adequate
time
for
among
colleagues
for
nurturing
its
content
and
typical
components
of
research
articles
in
the
life
